# MoodList (A Playlist Generator): Listen to how you feel

Have you ever been feeling a certain type of way, but your Spotify playlists just don't seem to link up with your mood? Well no more.

## How it works

MoodList is able to determine your mood based on a number of factors including current weather and the determined mood of your recent Facebook posts!

Currently, MoodList compares certain key words and phrases from your posts and caclulates your overall, recent mood.

### Supported Moods
* Happy
* Sad

## Scheduled Updates
* None: this code is outdated and the repository is being used solely as a showcase.
* May revisit this idea and develop a MoodList II with more advanced sentiment analysis and machine learning.
